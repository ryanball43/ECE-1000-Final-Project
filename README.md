# ECE-1000-Final-Project
This includes all references, code, and details of how we made our robot arm for our ECE-1000 Final Project.
## Project Summary
We chose to make a robot arm because we thought it would be fun. It has not been fun however, it has been a good learning process. During this project we have learned how to code in MicroPython, how to submit a 3D print, how to integrate servos into coding, and how to deal with random errors in coding. This project has tested our academic abilities as well as our problem solving skills. We have constructed a robotic arm controlled by joystick.
## Project Capabilities
The inital collaboration, was focused on coding in micropython the commands of each servo motor associated with each chosen joystick movement. Then the dimensions of our design were established and 3D printed. After essembly here are the current capabilities of our robotic arm.
* Has the ability of 360 degrees of rotation in accordance to the rotation of the joystick.
* Has the ability to move vertically in response to joystick movement.
* Has claw with the ability to open and close in accordance to the clicking of the joystick.
## Who Are We? Dr. Bhattacharya's ECE - 1000 Students
* Lloyd (Michael) Harris - Novice Eletrical Engineering Major
    * Builder - Wired the board to make sure the arm would function
* Ryan Ball - Novice Computer Engineering Major
    * Design and Build - found the design for the robot arm and assembled the pieces
* Logan Garrett - Novice Eletrical Engineering Major
    * Coder - Handled the code to make the servos work.

* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) was used to help during the coding process. We used ChatGPT specifically to help get started, fix random errors we couldn't fix ourselves, and to understand the Raspberry Pi Pico Board.
